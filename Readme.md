# Description

This is a custom build of Morfologik dictionary.
The following make tasks are introduced:
* all forms can be downcased
* all abbreviations are removed
* tab is a separator instead of a semicolon

The primary reason for this repository is the need to use an old version of SOLR
with some custom changes. It is not a good idea to fork this repository. 
Please use the original repository instead.
